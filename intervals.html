        <h1>Intervals</h1>
        <p>
            An interval is the distance betwwen two notes. 
            Unison, fourths, fifths, and octaves are <strong>perfect</strong>
            intervals when in their fundamental form. <br><br>  
            Raising the top tone of a perfect interval changes it to
            an augmented interval. Lowering the top tone changes it to a 
            diminished interval.  <br><br>
            Non-perfect diatonic intervals are major in their fundamental form. 
            When lowered, they become minor, and when raised they become 
            augmented. Lowering a minor interval 
            makes it a diminished interval.  <br><br>
            <h3>Perfect intervals: </h3><br>
            Diminished - Perfect - Augmented <br><br>
            <h3>Major and minor intervals: </h3><br>
            Diminished - minor - major - Augmented  <br><br>

            m = minor <br>
            M = Major <br>
            D = Diminished <br>
